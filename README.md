# Premature Neonatal Mortality Prediction

Research question: Do machine learning algorithms based on EHR data outperform accepted clinical risk scores in predicting in-hospital mortality of premature babies who are transferred to the NICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center?

This project was conducted using the MIMIC-IV v1.0 EHR dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/1.0/).
